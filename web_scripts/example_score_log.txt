    "Why are you interested in joining BUILD?": "I have learnt several technologies, full stack web development, and done several projects on my own. However, I want to be a part of an organisation through which I can execute my skills on a bigger platform and scale. I want to create an application used by several people, and understand how working in a software engineering team can be like",
    "What is the coolest (CS related) thing you have worked on?": "I created a web application which was integrated with the Spotify API. I used React Js to create an application where people could find songs, create their own playlists and export that playlist to their Spotify account. The application also had other features such as adding and removing songs from their playlist, playing those songs. Since it was my first project with React, html, css and google ui designs and interfaces, I feel like it still feels like one of the coolest things I have worked on.",
